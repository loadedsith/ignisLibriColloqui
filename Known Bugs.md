#Known Bugs
Profile shows on login, its because there's a moment where the user has facebook user, but not user profile, which triggers a "no profile" check for new users... it remains in this state until the profile is there, but it doesnt automatically disappear
No way to change current topic
have to refresh after facebook login
rooms arent subscribed to as soon as they are created, it takes a refresh to get the server to update our subscriptions
